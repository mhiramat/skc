Supplemental Kernel Commandline
================================

:Author: Masami Hiramatsu <mhiramat@kernel.org>

Overview
========

Supplemental Kernel Commandline (SKC) is expanding current kernel cmdline
to support additional key-value data when boot the kernel in efficient way.
This allows adoministrators to pass a tree-structured key-value text file
(SKC file) via bootloaders.

SKC File Syntax
===============

SKC basic syntax is simple. Each key consists of dot-connected-words, and
key and value are connected by "=". The value has to be terminated by semi-
colon (";"). For array value, array entries are separated by comma (",").

KEY[.WORD[...]] = VALUE[, VALUE2[...]];

Each key word only contains alphabet, number, dash ("-") or underscore ("_").
If a value need to contain the delimiters, you can use double-quotes to
quote it. A double quote in VALUE can be escaped by backslash. There can
be a key which doesn't have value or has an empty value. Those keys are
used for checking the key exists or not (like a boolean).

Tree Structure
--------------

SKC allows user to fold partially same word keys by brace. For example,

foo.bar.baz = value1;
foo.bar.qux.quux = value2;

These can be written also in

foo.bar {
   baz = value1;
   qux.quux = value2;
}

SKC APIs
========

User can query or loop on key-value pairs, also it is possible to find
a root (prefix) key node and find key-values under that node.

Typical usage is to find key-value pair by skc_find_value() directly,
iterate all keys by skc_for_each_key_value() and compair fixed key
string with the key string composed by skc_node_compose_key(), or
find a root node by skc_find_node() and iterates all key-values under
that node by skc_node_for_each_key_value().

Locking is not needed, since after initialized, SKC becomes readonly.
All data and keys must be copied if you need to modify it.


Functions and structures
========================

.. kernel-doc:: include/linux/skc.h
.. kernel-doc:: lib/skc.c


/proc/sup_cmdline
=================

/proc/sup_cmdline is the user-space interface of supplemental kernel
cmdline. Unlike /proc/cmdline, this file shows the key-value style list.
Each key-value pair is shown in each line with following style.

KEY[.WORDS...] = "[VALUE]"[,"VALUE2"...];

How to Pass at Boot
===================

SKC file is passed to kernel via memory, so the boot loader must support
loading SKC file. After loading the SKC file on memory, the boot loader
has to add "skc=PADDR,SIZE" argument to kernel cmdline, where the PADDR
is the physical address of the memory block and SIZE is the size of SKC
file.
